This is basic execution on Convoluted neural network module for classifying the input image as cat or dog. 
This project is executed based on the dataset obtained from kaggle website. 
The dataset can be loaded in cloud platforms(eg Drive) and can be used for training and testing purposes. 
Cat and Dog Image Classifier

Overview:
This project is an image classification model that differentiates between cats and dogs. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained with TensorFlow/Keras. 
The project also includes a web application built with Flask, allowing users to upload images and receive predictions.

Features:
Classifies images as either Cat or Dog.
Provides a web-based interface for user interaction.
Uses a pre-trained CNN model for high accuracy.
Saves and loads the model in .keras format for easy deployment.

Tech Stack:
Programming Language: Python

Libraries:
TensorFlow/Keras (for model building and training)
Flask (for web app development)
NumPy (for data manipulation)
Pillow (for image processing)

Tools:
Virtual Environment (venv or conda)

Dataset:
The dataset contains two folders:
Cat: Contains images of cats.
Dog: Contains images of dogs.
